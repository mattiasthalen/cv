    projects:
      - name: Jaktia
        date: 2025
        highlights:
          - Developed the architecture using dlt (dltHub) for rapid and stable ingestion of source data, and SQLMesh (dbt alternative) for transforming the raw data up until consumption. Follows a medallion architecture where we first historize the raw data, then organize it around core business concepts using the Hook methodology and finally deliver a self-service unified star schema to be consumed in PowerBI / Excel.

        highlights:
          - Developed the architecture using dlt (dltHub) for ingestion. Qlik was used for the transformation. Follows the Analytical Data Storage System, where the first layer is according to how the system data looks. The middle layer is centered around how the business looks at the data; this is done by organizing it around core business concepts (the Hook Methodology). The last, and final layer is according to requirements, where we opted for the Unified Start Schema, due to it’s rapid and self-service centered core values.
